A little game where we have various options for fighting against the monster.

We got a **battle log** where we can see what happened, for example how much damage we dealt and most importantly in this game we practice all the core basics of Vue:
1. data binding
2. interpollation
3. **v-bind**
4. event binding with **v-on**
5. how to output list data with **v-for**
6. conditional content with **v-if**
